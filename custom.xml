<!--
This is the Create Custom level file. It sets the size of the level, what environment to use and all objects, such as vox-models, scripts and boundary, used in the level.
Positions are given in meters relative to their parent objects position. In this level no objects are parented and hence positions are in reference to the bottom center of the game world.
Voxbox sizes are given in voxels. One voxel is 0.1 meters on all sides.
This level contains a plain voxbox as indestructible ground and an empty vox file. Open the vox file in MagicaVoxel and create something, then load this level from the Create menu to see your creation in the game.
-->

<!--
The 'version' indicates what version of the editor was used to create the level. Leave it as is to make sure scripts are loaded as expected.
The 'shadowVolume' property sets the area of the game where lighting, and subsequently shadows, are calculated. It is expressed in meters; width, height, length
-->

	The 'template' property references a predefined setup of environments. Available environment templates are: 'sunny', 'night', 'sunset', 'sunrise', 'foggy', and 'rain'
